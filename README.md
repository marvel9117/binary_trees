0x1D. C - Binary trees

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The topmost node in the tree is called the root node. If a node has no children, it is called a leaf node.

Here are some key concepts and terms associated with binary trees:

Node: Each element in a binary tree is called a node. Each node contains a value (data) and references to its left and right children, if they exist.

Root: The topmost node of a binary tree is called the root. It is the starting point for traversing the tree.

Parent and Child Nodes: A node in a binary tree may have zero, one, or two children. The nodes below a given node are called its children, and the node above them is called their parent.

Leaf Node: A leaf node is a node that has no children (i.e., both the left and right child references are NULL).

Internal Node: An internal node is a node that has at least one child.

Depth: The depth of a node in a binary tree is the length of the path from the root to that node. The depth of the root node is 0.

Height: The height of a binary tree is the maximum depth of any node in the tree. The height of an empty tree is defined to be -1, and the height of a tree with only one node (the root) is 0.

Binary Tree Traversal: Traversal refers to visiting and processing each node of the tree in a specific order. The three most common types of tree traversal are:

In-order traversal: Visit the left subtree, then the root, and finally the right subtree.
Pre-order traversal: Visit the root, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
Post-order traversal: Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root.
Binary trees are widely used in computer science for various applications, including representing hierarchical data (e.g., file systems, organization charts), implementing search algorithms (e.g., binary search trees), and building expression trees for arithmetic operations. They provide an efficient way to store and manipulate data, and many algorithms and data structures are based on or leverage the properties of binary trees.
